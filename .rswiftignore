# The format of the file is nearly the same as a .gitignore file. 
# Wildcards like * and ** are supported and you can add comments 
# by starting a line with a #. Explicitly including single or 
# multiple files that are otherwise globally ignored is also 
# supported by starting a pattern with !.
